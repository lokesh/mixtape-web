**This project is not actively being worked on.**

The ```bower.json``` specifies ```latest``` as the version number for all the deps. There have been many breaking changes introduced by the deps since this project was started, particular Backone Marionette. To get things up and running requires updating the code to use the latest versions of the deps and hardcoding the version numbers in ```bower.json``` to prevent this issue in the future.
